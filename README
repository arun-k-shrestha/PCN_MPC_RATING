MPC-Based Payment Channel Network Simulation
This project simulates a Payment Channel Network (PCN) that integrates Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) for privacy-preserving route verification and a decentralized node rating system to enhance routing reliability. The goal is to evaluate how combining MPC-based liquidity checks with decentralized reputation improves payment success rates and resilience against adversarial or unreliable nodes.

Features
Synthetic PCN Generation: Create a simulated network of nodes and bidirectional payment channels, reflecting real-world Lightning Network properties.

MPC-Based Route Discovery: Uses MPC (e.g., Yao’s Millionaires’ Problem) to privately verify liquidity along candidate paths before payment initiation.

Decentralized Node Rating: Each node maintains local ratings (binary: success/failure) of other nodes based on transaction outcomes, supporting privacy and flexible trust models.

Adversarial Behavior Simulation: Optionally injects malicious nodes (e.g., non-cooperating, jamming, or unreliable) to test network resilience.

Hybrid Path Selection: Routing algorithm combines MPC feasibility checks with node ratings to select the most reliable paths.

Experimental Analysis: Outputs statistics on payment success rates, routing efficiency, and the impact of rating propagation.
